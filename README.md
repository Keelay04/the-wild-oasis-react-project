# The Wild Oasis (Admin)

Developed an internal admin dashboard using React Router to manage cabin listings, pricing, and booking
operations.

Used React Query to handle server-state management (caching, background refetching, and mutation handling)
to keep admin views consistent after updates.

Implemented Supabase authentication for admin-only access to restrict management features to authorized staff
accounts.
